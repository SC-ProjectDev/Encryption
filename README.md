# Combo Chaos Crypto 2.2 – Captain Cubit Edition

Secure encryption with cryptographic integrity, roast-infused entropy, and a healthy dose of dumbass chaos. Now with Rickroll safety, cubit-free logic, and full raccoon gospel compatibility.

---

## 🔐 Features

- ✔ Argon2id key derivation (tunable, memory-hard)
- ✔ AES-GCM authenticated encryption
- ✔ Rickroll footer injection (50% chance, non-corrupting)
- ✔ "trash" keyword detection triggers gospel drop (25+ instances)
- ✔ Fully random salt and nonce per encryption
- ✔ Interactive command-line UI (no arguments needed)
- ✔ Metaphorically clean, structurally unhinged

---

## 🧙‍♂️ How to Use

```bash
$ python combo_chaos_2_2.py
```

You will be prompted for:
- Mode: `enc` or `dec`
- Target type: `file` or `dir`
- Source path
- Destination path
- Password (prompted securely)

All encryption output ends with `.enc` in directory mode.
All decryption automatically strips `.enc` suffix.

## 🔹 Rickroll Footprint

Each encryption has a 50% chance of embedding a Rick Astley chorus in the *footer*. It is harmless, hilarious, and perfectly secure.

If triggered:
```
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
```

---

## 🛡️ Easter Egg

If your decrypted plaintext includes the word `trash` **25 or more times**, a sacred raccoon gospel will be dropped:

> `Raccoon_Gospel_IV.txt`

With contents:
```
[FIRE] Raccoon Gospel Book IV: Trash Canon
```

Because sometimes truth is buried in garbage.
